This is very handy when using event handlers. So, why do we use setState rather than just mutating state directly? Well, React keeps a copy of the previous state and uses it as a reference point. When we use setState, it creates a new item in the systems memory… a distinctly different item from the original… Now, React has the ability to distinguish what needs to be re-rendered based on the previous state. If we were to mutate state directly, not only would we lose this functionality, but since there is no reference point, adding to or changing the value of an existing element is still going to equal it’s previous state.\n                    </p>\n                </article>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    );\n};\n\nexport default Blogs;"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAP,MAAkB,OAAlB;;;AAEA,MAAMC,KAAK,GAAG,MAAM;EAChB,oBACI;IAAK,SAAS,EAAC,YAAf;IAAA,uBACI;MAAA,wBACI;QAAS,SAAS,EAAC,sBAAnB;QAAA,wBACI;UAAG,SAAS,EAAC,mBAAb;UAAA,wBAAiC;YAAM,SAAS,EAAC,oBAAhB;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAjC;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QADJ,eAEI;UAAG,SAAS,EAAC,cAAb;UAAA,wBAA4B;YAAM,SAAS,EAAC,oBAAhB;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAA5B;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAFJ;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QADJ,eAOI;QAAS,SAAS,EAAC,sBAAnB;QAAA,wBACI;UAAG,SAAS,EAAC,mBAAb;UAAA,wBAAiC;YAAM,SAAS,EAAC,oBAAhB;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAjC;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QADJ,eAEI;UAAG,SAAS,EAAC,cAAb;UAAA,wBAA4B;YAAM,SAAS,EAAC,oBAAhB;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAA5B,qGAEI;YAAA,uBAAG;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA;UAAH;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAFJ,eAGI;YAAA,uBAAG;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA;UAAH;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAHJ,eAII;YAAA,uBAAG;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA;UAAH;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAJJ;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAFJ;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAPJ,eAgBI;QAAS,SAAS,EAAC,sBAAnB;QAAA,wBACI;UAAG,SAAS,EAAC,mBAAb;UAAA,wBAAiC;YAAM,SAAS,EAAC,oBAAhB;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAjC;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QADJ,eAEI;UAAG,SAAS,EAAC,cAAb;UAAA,wBAA4B;YAAM,SAAS,EAAC,oBAAhB;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAA5B;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAFJ;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAhBJ,eAqBI;QAAS,SAAS,EAAC,sBAAnB;QAAA,wBACI;UAAG,SAAS,EAAC,mBAAb;UAAA,wBAAiC;YAAM,SAAS,EAAC,oBAAhB;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAjC;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QADJ,eAEI;UAAG,SAAS,EAAC,cAAb;UAAA,wBAA4B;YAAM,SAAS,EAAC,oBAAhB;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAA5B,8UACI;YAAG,SAAS,EAAC,MAAb;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QADJ;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAFJ;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QArBJ,eA2BI;QAAS,SAAS,EAAC,sBAAnB;QAAA,wBACI;UAAG,SAAS,EAAC,mBAAb;UAAA,wBAAiC;YAAM,SAAS,EAAC,oBAAhB;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAjC;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QADJ,eAEI;UAAG,SAAS,EAAC,cAAb;UAAA,wBAA4B;YAAM,SAAS,EAAC,oBAAhB;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAA5B;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAFJ;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QA3BJ;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EADJ;IAAA;IAAA;IAAA;EAAA,QADJ;AAqCH,CAtCD;;KAAMA,K;AAwCN,eAAeA,KAAf"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
